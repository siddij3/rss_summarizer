The federation of social news aggregation has also gained traction as users turn to alternatives like Lemmy and Kbin in response to changes in platforms like Reddit. The sustainability and safeguarding of these decentralized projects against government overreach remain challenges. There is ongoing work on protocols and libraries that enable decentralized services, such as Veilid and Spritely, promising secure and private data exchange. The European Union's Digital Markets Act and the More Instant Messaging Interoperability working group are pushing for open interoperability and end-to-end encryption in messaging platforms. The DWeb Camp and EFF's testimony on blockchain highlight the importance of policy discussions and exploration in the decentralized web space.

However, applying the FDA model to AI raises several challenges due to the differences between the two domains. The FDA has a long history of overseeing novel and high-risk technologies, which can serve as inspiration for AI governance. FDA-style approval and oversight would involve risk and novelty-driven oversight, continuous engagement with developers, wide-ranging information access, burden of proof on developers, and a balance between innovation and safety. The FDA model's cost of compliance and limitations are acknowledged, but adjustments can be made to reduce costs while ensuring risk reduction. It is important to consider other regulatory agencies, such as the FAA and NHTSA, for their expertise in specific sectors. International cooperation and standard-setting could also play a role in AI governance, with mutual acceptance of regulatory approvals across jurisdictions. The EU's AI Act has some elements that align with the FDA model, such as a co-developed code of practice for safety and efficacy. Overall, there is a need to find regulatory approaches that address the unique risks and challenges posed by AI technologies."}

The Protecting Kids on Social Media Act, which combines elements of other child safety bills, also raises concerns about unconstitutional provisions and restrictions on free speech. The fight against these bills has mobilized young people who have become targets for online censorship and surveillance.

Missouri highlights allegations of illegal government pressure on social media platforms to censor COVID safety measures, vaccine information, and other topics. The EFF and the Center for Democracy and Technology are urging the court to rely on the First Amendment test from the Bantam Books v. Sullivan ruling to determine the permissibility of government contacts with social media platforms. The EFF is calling for the court to provide guidance to distinguish between attempts to convince and attempts to coerce. The current injunction limiting government contacts with social media platforms lacks clear distinctions, according to the EFF and CDT.

Skeptical hypotheses like the deceiving demon and the brain in the vat challenge our ability to have knowledge about the external world. Fallibilism is a common response to these challenges, asserting that we can still have knowledge even if we cannot rule out all alternative possibilities. However, the rise of deep fake technology and AI-generated content threatens our ability to have knowledge as it becomes difficult to trust information channels. A solution proposed is a cryptographic system where individuals cryptographically sign their information to prove its authenticity and integrity. The challenge lies in the lack of a widely adopted platform for managing public and private keys. Establishing a default use of public keys could help solve this problem, similar to how HTTPS became the default for secure websites. Cooperation among technology companies and collective action is needed to address this issue."}

From healthcare to finance, AI is being harnessed to solve complex problems and improve efficiency. This article explores some of the key advances in AI and its potential impact on the future.\n\nContent:\n\n1. Deep Learning and Neural Networks:\nDeep learning, a subset of machine learning, has revolutionized AI. It involves training artificial neural networks with vast amounts of data to recognize patterns and make predictions. These networks can \"learn\" from the data, improving performance over time. Deep learning has been applied successfully in image and speech recognition, natural language processing, and even autonomous vehicles.\n\n2. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs):\nGANs are a type of AI model consisting of a generator and a discriminator network. The generator creates new data instances, such as images, while the discriminator tries to distinguish between real and generated data. Through continuous interaction, GANs have achieved remarkable results in creating realistic images and videos, even mimicking human art styles.\n\n3. Reinforcement Learning:\nReinforcement learning enables AI systems to learn optimal actions through trial and error. By rewarding correct behaviors and penalizing mistakes, AI agents can learn to navigate complex environments and achieve specific goals. Applications of reinforcement learning include robotics, gaming, and autonomous systems.\n\n4. Explainable AI:\nAs AI becomes increasingly sophisticated, there is a growing need for transparency and explainability. Explainable AI aims to provide insights into how AI systems make decisions, enabling humans to understand and trust the algorithms. This is particularly important in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance, where accountability and ethical considerations are crucial.\n\n5. Edge AI and IoT:\nEdge AI refers to AI algorithms running on edge devices, such as smartphones or IoT devices, rather than relying on cloud-based processing. This enables faster, more efficient AI applications, as data processing occurs locally. Edge AI is particularly useful in real-time applications, such as autonomous vehicles or smart home devices.\n\n6. Quantum Computing and AI:\nQuantum computing holds promise for accelerating AI developments through its ability to process vast amounts of data simultaneously. Quantum machine learning algorithms are being explored to enhance AI capabilities and solve complex problems more efficiently. Though still in its early stages, the intersection of quantum computing and AI could lead to game-changing advancements.\n\nKey Ideas Summarized:\n\n- AI breakthroughs like deep learning and neural networks have revolutionized various industries, from healthcare to autonomous vehicles.\n- Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved impressive results in creating realistic images and videos.\n- Reinforcement learning enables AI systems to learn optimal actions through trial and error, benefiting areas such as robotics and gaming.\n- Explainable AI is crucial for transparency and accountability, particularly in sensitive domains like healthcare and finance.\n- Edge AI allows for faster and more efficient AI applications by running algorithms on local devices.\n- Quantum computing has the potential to accelerate AI developments and solve complex problems more efficiently when combined with machine learning algorithms."}

In a brief filed to the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania, the EFF argues that these warrants lack probable cause and target innocent people. The case in question involves a search warrant issued to Google, but if upheld, it could be applied to any search engine user. The EFF asserts that keyword search warrants are incompatible with constitutional protections and have no place in a democratic society. These warrants are concerning because they do not target specific individuals, but instead require the search of an entire database based on keywords specified by the police. The EFF argues that these warrants violate constitutional rights and harm protected speech and the right to receive information. They also argue that these warrants could have a chilling effect on users seeking out information, as they may fear their searches being monitored by the police. Overall, the EFF and other organizations are urging the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to find keyword search warrants unconstitutional."}

AI, the ability of machines to imitate human intelligence and perform tasks that typically require human intelligence, holds enormous potential but also poses significant challenges.\n\nOne of the key promises of AI is its potential to revolutionize various industries and improve our daily lives. For example, AI-powered algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to provide valuable insights and predictions in fields such as healthcare, finance, and transportation. With AI, doctors can diagnose diseases more accurately, financial institutions can detect fraud more effectively, and self-driving cars can navigate roads more safely.\n\nHowever, along with these promises come potential perils. One major concern is the ethical implications of AI. As AI systems become more sophisticated, they may make decisions that have unintended consequences or exhibit biased behavior. This raises questions about who is accountable for the outcomes generated by AI algorithms and how to ensure fairness and transparency in their decision-making processes.\n\nAnother challenge is the impact of AI on the job market. While AI can automate repetitive and mundane tasks, it also raises concerns about potential job displacement. As machines become more capable, some jobs may no longer require human involvement, leading to unemployment and economic inequality. The challenge lies in finding ways to harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its negative impact on employment.\n\nAdditionally, privacy and security are significant concerns in the age of AI. As AI systems collect and analyze vast amounts of personal data, there is a risk of data breaches and unauthorized access.

(arXiv:2401.12391v1 [cs.IT])", "date": "2024-01-25", "summary": "This paper discusses the approximation of pufferfish privacy when the adversary's belief of published data is Gaussian distributed. The use of Monge's optimal transport plan allows for the achievement of $(\u03b5, \u03b4)$-pufferfish privacy by calibrating additive Laplace noise to the differences in mean and variance of the conditioned Gaussian distributions. The method is applicable to private summation or average queries, with sufficient conditions provided for approximating $\u03b5$-statistical indistinguishability in sensitive data. The approach is further extended to arbitrary prior beliefs trained by Gaussian mixture models, achieving $(\u03b5,\u03b4)$-pufferfish privacy by calibrating noise to a convex combination of mean and variance differences between Gaussian components."}

The bill would prevent federal law enforcement from monitoring journalists' phone, messaging, or email records and limit the government's ability to force journalists to disclose their sources. Currently, federal law lacks protections for journalists, leading to abuses and a chilling effect on journalism. The PRESS Act has bipartisan support and is backed by press and rights groups. It is crucial for democracy to safeguard the rights of journalists and citizens to gather and publish information. In other news, the UAE has placed 84 detainees on trial for alleged involvement in a secret organization aimed at committing acts of violence and terrorism. There is also an increase in anti-LGBTQ+ intolerance globally, leading to self-censorship of online expression. Several countries have introduced initiatives restricting freedom of expression and privacy for LGBTQ+ individuals.

Include line staff, customers/patients, managers/executives, and any other affected parties.\n4. Divide the initial time estimates by five (or turnover time if less than 5 years) and add it to the yearly time to get the total annualized time cost.\n5. Divide the hours by 2000 for the annualized full-time equivalent (FTE) cost.\n6. Estimate benefits by finding evidence of health benefits or doing an expert elicitation.\n7. Convert benefit estimates into life-years gained using DALY values.\n8. If there are monetary benefits, divide them by the GDP per capita of the receiving country.\n9. Compare the annualized FTE cost to the annualized life-years gained.\n10. If the FTE cost is less than the life-year benefit, the policy passes the cost-benefit test.\n11.

The proposed UN Cybercrime Treaty could further restrict free expression and empower states to access and share user data.

Some of these laws have been blocked for violating the First Amendment, but others are set to go into effect. The Age Appropriate Design Code Act in California set the stage for these regulations, but its constitutionality is currently being appealed. Similar laws have been passed in Utah, Arkansas, and Texas, with some of them also facing legal challenges. The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) opposes age verification requirements and advocates for comprehensive data privacy legislation instead. They argue that these laws infringe on individuals' rights to access information and impinge on privacy and speech rights. The EFF has been actively involved in fighting against these laws and will continue to do so in court battles that will likely determine young people's access to the internet in the future.

Algorithmic feeds on social media platforms prioritize posts that capture attention, leading to filter bubbles and the spread of fake news. Virality-fostering feeds, like those seen on TikTok, incentivize the posting of false information to gain attention. Lack of algorithmic transparency and accountability allows fake news to freely circulate. AI-deepfakes make it easier for bad actors to create believable false content. Monetization programs on social networks incentivize the creation of viral content, including fake news, for monetary gain. The lack of a \"fact-check culture\" on social media platforms, where metrics determine the visibility and legitimacy of posts, further contributes to the spread of disinformation. The consequences of social media disinformation can be significant, especially in the context of wars and social conflicts. To combat disinformation, individuals should only trust credible sources and verify information before sharing it. However, current approaches, such as the Digital Services Act, may not be sufficient in addressing the problem."}

(arXiv:2401.12236v2 [cs.LG] UPDATED)", "date": "2024-01-28", "summary": "Recent studies show that large machine learning models trained on noisy data have good generalization capabilities. However, this study uncovers a surprising result - even if the ground truth is robust to adversarial examples and the overfitted model is benign, this overfitting process can be harmful when faced with adversarial manipulation. The study proves that the min-norm estimator in an overparameterized linear model always leads to adversarial vulnerability in the \"benign overfitting\" setting. Additionally, there is an asymptotic trade-off between the standard risk and the \"adversarial\" risk in ridge regression estimators, meaning that both risks cannot be small simultaneously. Similar results are observed in two-layer neural tangent kernel models. This finding provides theoretical insights into the phenomenon observed in practice where true target functions are robust, but overfitted neural networks are not."}

Finding the best set of vertices in a tournament is a well-studied problem in social choice theory. In many applications, such as selecting the best drugs from a set, the edges of the tournament are only implicitly given and determining the orientation of an edge is costly. We want to find the best set of vertices by querying as few edges as possible. This paper focuses on studying this problem for various tournament solutions. The set of Condorcet non-losers in a tournament can be found by querying a specific number of edges, and this is the minimum number of edges that need to be queried. Other popular tournament solutions require querying a quadratic number of edges in the worst case. However, if the size of the top cycle in the tournament is small, all tournament solutions can be found by querying a certain number of edges."}

Algorithmic feeds, which show curated posts based on algorithms, promote filter bubbles and help fake news spread rapidly. Virality-fostering feeds, similar to TikTok's algorithm, incentivize the posting of alarming and false information. Lack of algorithmic transparency allows the free circulation of fake news, without giving users control over filtering them. Additionally, the absence of accountability mechanisms for spreading misinformation further contributes to the problem. The proliferation of AI-deepfakes, the monetization of user content, and the lack of a fact-check culture on social media also play a role in worsening disinformation. These algorithmic-based systems have harmful consequences, particularly in the context of wars and social conflicts.

However, it is important to recognize that science is a cumulative enterprise that seeks to accumulate good explanations of phenomena. While some scientific advances may simplify models, the goal of science is to explain more and better. As our scientific knowledge increases, the storage space required for this knowledge increases, putting a limit on the amount of knowledge that can be maintained and potentially hindering knowledge creation. Possible solutions to alleviate this burden include compressing knowledge into more parsimonious theories, improving knowledge transfer, and offloading knowledge to tools. However, there are challenges such as the combinatorial nature of breakthrough innovation and the complexity of certain systems. Additionally, the burden of knowledge raises questions about the nature and value of knowledge. Science can be seen as a means of producing technologies or as a pursuit of understanding reality. Scientific prioritization becomes increasingly important in a world with limited cognitive resources. The problem of science friction is likely caused by a combination of institutional inefficiency, the burden of knowledge, and the low-hanging fruit problem. Although institutional interventions offer potential solutions, further study is needed to improve the way science is conducted."}

Singer argues that if one has the power to prevent harm without sacrificing something morally important, they should do so. However, this principle is considered too demanding. A counter-argument by Travis Timmerman proposes a new thought experiment to determine when one is morally permitted to stop saving children. Although these thought experiments may be in tension, it is important to prioritize the one that aligns with moral consistency. Reconciling with the demanding nature of maximizing ethics involves considering the influence it has on our ability to live by it. Giving up certain pleasures, such as buying coffee, risks compromising our adherence to a maximizing principle. Scalar consequentialism suggests that actions should be evaluated based on the relative amounts of value they produce. The objection to Timmerman's thought experiment being ad hoc and arbitrary is unclear and lacks justification."}

SongBsAb adds imperceptible changes to the singing voices before they are released, disrupting the generation process of SVC and resulting in unexpected voices. This approach disrupts both the singer's identity and the lyrics, preventing the SVC from imitating the target singer or preserving the original lyrics. To make the changes imperceptible, a psychoacoustic model-based loss is utilized, taking into account the accompanying background track. Additionally, a frame-level interaction reduction-based loss is introduced to improve the transferability of the generated voices.

However, these models often struggle to accurately represent specific attributes. To address this, a training-free approach is proposed to modulate the guidance direction of diffusion models during inference. The approach decomposes prompt semantics into concepts and monitors the guidance trajectory in relation to each concept. Deviations from prompt semantics are correlated with divergence from concepts, so the technique steers the guidance direction towards any concept that the model diverges from. Experimental results show that this method improves the semantic alignment of generated images in response to prompts."}

The World Privacy Forum reviewed various AI governance tools and found that many include faulty AI fixes that can undermine fairness and explainability. Kate Kaye, Deputy Director of the World Privacy Forum, discussed the findings and emphasized the need for strong assessment processes for measurement methods used in AI governance. She also highlighted the importance of considering data privacy in the context of AI, as current frameworks may not adequately address the challenges posed by AI systems. Kaye mentioned several examples of AI governance tools, including the implementation of responsible AI considerations in government procurement processes in Chile and the use of off-label measurement methods like the 80% rule and SHAP/LIME in various AI governance tools. The involvement of large tech companies in shaping these governance tools was noted, with policymakers often relying on industry for guidance. The report also highlighted the role of organizations like the OECD in developing governance frameworks and the need for better evaluation and documentation in this field. The ongoing research aims to stay updated on the proliferation of AI governance tools and frameworks. Noteworthy documents mentioned include the work of the Masakhane Research Foundation in developing contextually relevant data sets for AI training and New Zealand's robust process for evaluating algorithms with a focus on privacy and indigenous data considerations."}

These programs rely on prediction models to target beneficiaries. However, biases in the data and instability in the prediction models can lead to substantial underestimation of welfare losses. Measurement errors and biases in the data can disadvantage certain groups, particularly smaller households. It is important to consider the characteristics of misclassified households to ensure social protection systems align with local redistributive preferences and do not have hidden discriminatory biases. There is a need for transparency and accountability in targeting procedures to avoid unfair practices and to build trust in the allocation of funds. The use of data-driven decision-making systems in public policy should be carefully monitored for biases and potential discrimination. Further research is needed to explore alternative targeting approaches and to incorporate fairness considerations in social protection systems."}

However, these systems face operational and financial challenges, leading to concerns about their ability to provide quality services. Key issues include overcrowding, lack of reliability, fare evasion, safety and security problems, and poor maintenance. These problems are often the result of institutional and financial constraints, rather than issues with the BRT mode itself. Recommendations for improving BRT include permanent management and investment, attention to data and technology innovation, urban integration, and public participation. Despite these challenges, BRT remains an important component of sustainable mobility networks and can help address the global transit crisis. The number of cities implementing BRT has declined in recent years, following a trend similar to the deployment of tramways in the early 20th century. BRT systems are now part of public transport systems in 187 cities worldwide, with Latin America leading in terms of the number of systems, kilometers, and passengers. However, there has been a decline in the number of new cities adopting BRT and the number of kilometers added in the last five years. This decline follows a common pattern of innovation adoption. BRT faces several contentious issues, including institutional arrangements, competition for road space, and the misperception of buses as a low-quality mode. Challenges in BRT planning and implementation include lack of capacity and alignment among stakeholders, perceptions of BRT as a lower quality mode compared to rail systems, and opposition from advocates for nonmotorized transport. These challenges are not exclusive to BRT but are common in mobility improvement projects in developing countries. Despite these challenges, BRT has the potential to contribute to sustainable mobility and can be part of integrated transit systems. Innovation and technology, such as the use of electric buses, real-time data, and automation, can help improve BRT operations and service quality. Attention to urban impacts and community engagement is also crucial to winning public acceptance and support. However, the current downward trend in transit ridership and new public transportation projects, as well as transit reforms, pose additional challenges to the expansion and improvement of BRT systems."}

Watermarking schemes have been proposed but have proven to be easily removable. Manipulating the least perceptible bits of an image can create a watermark, but it is not robust against editing. Content authenticity, adding metadata to camera-generated images, is a more workable solution. Watermarking text-based generative AI is even more challenging as it must be robust against modification. Detection tools for watermarked text can either be publicly available, making them less useful, or kept secret, hindering their scalability. Current detection tools for AI-generated content are inaccurate. It is unlikely that state-sponsored disinformation campaigns would use watermarking. Watermarking AI-generated content may have limited use, but it is uncertain if it will ultimately succeed."}

DNS encryption has recently gained traction with the standardization of DNS over TLS (DoT) and DNS over HTTPS (DoH). Utilizing QUIC to encrypt web communications and DNS resolution is a promising opportunity. This paper evaluates the benefit of using QUIC for DNS resolution (DoQ) and web content delivery (H3) with 0-RTT. Comparisons are made between different combinations of H3 and DoH/DoQ, as well as unencrypted DNS over UDP (DoUDP). When using H3 1-RTT, page load times with DoH can be significantly longer compared to unencrypted DNS with DoUDP. However, the cost of encryption can be reduced when using coalesced encrypted connections (DoQ + H3 0-RTT), resulting in faster page load times. Overall, utilizing QUIC for encrypted communication on the internet is the best option."}
