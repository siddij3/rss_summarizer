The federation of social news aggregation has also gained traction as users turn to alternatives like Lemmy and Kbin in response to changes in platforms like Reddit. The sustainability and safeguarding of these decentralized projects against government overreach remain challenges. There is ongoing work on protocols and libraries that enable decentralized services, such as Veilid and Spritely, promising secure and private data exchange. The European Union's Digital Markets Act and the More Instant Messaging Interoperability working group are pushing for open interoperability and end-to-end encryption in messaging platforms.

However, applying the FDA model to AI raises several challenges due to the differences between the two domains. The FDA has a long history of overseeing novel and high-risk technologies, which can serve as inspiration for AI governance. FDA-style approval and oversight would involve risk and novelty-driven oversight, continuous engagement with developers, wide-ranging information access, burden of proof on developers, and a balance between innovation and safety. The FDA model's cost of compliance and limitations are acknowledged, but adjustments can be made to reduce costs while ensuring risk reduction. It is important to consider other regulatory agencies, such as the FAA and NHTSA, for their expertise in specific sectors. International cooperation and standard-setting could also play a role in AI governance, with mutual acceptance of regulatory approvals across jurisdictions. The EU's AI Act has some elements that align with the FDA model, such as a co-developed code of practice for safety and efficacy.

The EFF advocates for laws requiring consent for face scanning. Rite Aid's program disproportionately affected BIPOC communities. The company's system falsely flagged customers and assumed guilt, increasing surveillance on people of color. The FTC also revealed problems with employee training and evaluation of customer harm. The use of facial recognition technology by federal agencies lacks oversight. A New Jersey appellate court ruled in favor of transparency in police use of facial recognition. Efforts to ban government use of the technology are growing across the US. Studies show the technology has higher error rates for people of color. The use of Live Facial Recognition technology at an outdoor event in the UK was a significant deployment. A study highlighted risks and limitations of smartphone apps used for electronic monitoring. San Francisco's police department violated laws by not responding adequately to EFF's requests for documents. There is a growing recognition of the problems with face recognition technology, and stronger laws and transparency are needed for protection."}
