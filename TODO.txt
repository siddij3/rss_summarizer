1. Transition topic analysis away from OpenAI modelling into something more local and cheaper or more efficient
2. Increase functionality of hyperdb
3. Decouple vectorization
4. I need something that makes a supercategory based on categories themselves to cluster queries easier
5. Create API for scraper and displayer

APIS:
1. Button SCRAPE -> PUT -> Scrapes articles and stores them in vector DB

------------------
1. Pull titles of RSS feeds
        - Categorize based on these

eg. 50 articles. pull titles of all those articles
categorize each article based on its title

Harmonize categories based on similar topics
(GPT 105 - look at some of these things)

Title - category -> We find a genus for several category titles

Title, Url, Summary, category

Scrape RSS feeds and display everything based on the last 24 hours. 
It auto-categorizes the topics from that day so simplifiy

Eg.

Potatos:
> Summary of 5 articles
urls and titles:

Llamas:
> Summary of 6 articles
urls and titles:
